## This project consists of 2 separate problems as described below

### Finding the best cloud plan
Letâ€™s say a cloud service offers different plans. For example, Office 365 has different plans called E1, F1, etc. 
Each plan has different features such as voice, email, archiving, etc. Now let say the user selects a set of features he/she wants. 
The goal is to write code in Java that finds the combination of plans that offers all selected features at the lowest price. 
Note that in some cases, it will be just one plan, but in other cases you will need 2 or more plans to get all the features you want.

### Linking nodes in a tree
Each Node represents an element of a tree and specifies a list of immediate children. 
The 'Children' property lists all children (in order) but the 'Right' property is set to null. 
Suppose you are given the root of a fully populated tree (i.e. a Node instance called rootNode). 
Write code in Java to set the 'Right' property so that each node is linked to right siblings without using a queue or stack.
